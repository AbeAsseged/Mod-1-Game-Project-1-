Game:
Player v Computer 

What's the Game?
Where you try to answer a countries name just based off of the map of the country along with the flag, its an open ended question no multipule choices, hence making the game a bit difficult.  The way the game works is when the player clicks on the map of the country with the falg on the map, a fill in the black appears on the top of the page if question is answered correctly the player will be notified if not also the player will be notified that the answer was incorrect. 

Used:
html,js and css 

How Gussing a country by the country's map along with the flag code works?

In html i used div to seperate as a generic container for my image questions and used hr element as a break line between my question and a p element for my questions and an image element embeds my image in the document also gave my iamge an id so that i can use it on my js to be able to insert it as a clickable image. 
In Js using an elements click event and getElemenById to be able to make an insertion of a clickable image from my html, when one clicks on the map of the country with its flag shaded on it by using prompt() a pop-up will appear on the screan and you type in the answer, furthermore Using an if else statment along with alert() method if answer entered is correct you will be notified with a statment of "Great Job", if one answered the question wrong you will also be notified with a statment of "You Are Incorrect, Try Agian!".


Code I am proud off is?

Assigning my images an id so that i can use elemts click and getElementById to make the images as a clickable image, along with Instance method prompt to dispay the answer box. 


Issues run-into 

My biggiest problem I had was I had to change up the way i was doing the project due to not working and time constriant. When I finally had the code working run into a ReferenceError stating document is not defined in JavaScript and took me a few minitutes before i figured the problem which was due to an html syntax error. Also had an issue with css with the images i uploaded. 

Why I choose the idea for the game? 

I enjoy geography and I beileve this game will help anyone who wants to bush on their knowledge in maps and flags of countries around the world as well.
